This is a localization project related to the intro to self-driving car nanodegree.

I have implemented sense function that calculates posterior probability of a 1-D grid after taking measurements to update initial beliefs and then performs normalization producing a final probability of a robot's position in the grid.

I have also implemented move function in a 1-D grid that simulates a robot's movement in the grid and then updates the position probability.

Moving on to 2-D grids, I have implemented the sense function to be applied to any 2-D grid cells.

These functions are the core to the localization problem in Google's self-driving cars.

I also used pdb which is a python debugger to debug unnoticed problems in python scripts.
